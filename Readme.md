## Features

- **Log Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures raw log data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of log entries to identify potential issues.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of log data and analysis results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tamilselvan-sde/log-analyser.git
   cd log-analyser
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess Logs**:
   - Place your raw log files in the `logs_data/` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python logs_preprocessor.py
     ```

2. **Perform Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Ensure preprocessed logs are available in the `model_outputs/` directory.
   - Run the main analysis script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Visualize Results**:
   - Use the demo dashboard to visualize analysis results:
     ```bash
     python demo_dashboard.py
     ```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`
- `dash`
- `plotly`

These can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Configuration

- **Log Files**: Place your raw log files in the `logs_data/` directory.
- **Preprocessed Data**: The preprocessed log data will be stored in the `model_outputs/` directory.
- **Visualization**: The `demo_dashboard.py` script uses data from the `model_outputs/` directory to generate visualizations.

## Documentation

- **`logs_preprocessor.py`**: Script for preprocessing raw log data.
- **`main.py`**: Main script for performing sentiment analysis on preprocessed logs.
- **`demo_dashboard.py`**: Script to launch a dashboard for visualizing analysis results.

## Examples

After running the analysis scripts, you can view the sentiment analysis results in the `sentiment_analysis_results.csv` file located in the `model_outputs/` directory. To visualize these results, run the `demo_dashboard.py` script and access the dashboard in your web browser.
